														<h1><strong>LURIA</strong></h1>
												</header>
												<p>Laboratory for Undergraduates in Russia's Interdisciplinary Atmosphere, or <b>LURIA</b>, was created to give undergraduates interested in science research and medicine the chance to study in a foreign country.  Future scientific breakthroughs will require extensive international collaboration, and <b>LURIA</b> provides rising researchers, physicians, and intellectuals the opportunity to see their work in a broader context than can be found in their home university classroom or laboratory. <b>LURIA</b> follows in the interdisciplinary tradition of Alexander Luria, a world-renowned Russian neuropsychologist whose greatest strength was reconciling his experimental work within larger theoretical traditions. <b>LURIA</b> students will be encouraged to meditate on the purpose of scientific inquiry from the point of view of different disciplines.</p>
												<ol>
														<li><i>1.</i> The advancement of scientific discovery through joint Russian-American research</li>
														<li><i>2.</i> The promotion of Russian-American relations through cultural and educational exchange opportunities</li>
												</ol>
												<p>By providing U.S. undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to travel abroad and work side-by-side with Russian professors and graduate students, as well as the opportunity to study Russian 
							language and culture, our students will graduate the program with practical experience in modern scientific practices and a deep understanding of modern Russian culture and language.

												Kevin Fomalont is Fulbright Program Alumnus who studied in St. Petersburg, Russia at the Institute of Experimental Medicine and completed a laboratory project investigating how early life infection combined with stress in adolescence contributes to the development of behavioral dysfunctions in adulthood associated with mental illness. As an undergraduate, he studied for 2 semesters in St. Petersburg and is enamored with the city's vibrant cultural atmosphere and its unorthodox residents. He worked for 2 years at the National Institute of Mental Health as a research fellow in the Laboratory of Neuropsychology before completing a Master's in Neuroscience at Emory University. He also holds bachelor's degrees in Psychology, Natural Science, and Russian from Penn State University.

												<br />
												Kevin co-founded this program because of his disappointment with the current study abroad options for American science undergraduates. He believes that scientific progress is not simply that which takes place inside an isolated laboratory, but is spurred on by exposure to varied intellectual traditions.
